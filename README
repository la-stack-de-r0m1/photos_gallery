1. Clone repository and enter de directory
   $ git clone https://github.com/romainbe/photos_gallery.git
   $ cd photos_gallery

2. Setup the database
   - Rename the file .env.sample into .env:
   $ cp .env.sample .env

   - Open the .env file and, in the line DATABASE_URL (mysql in the exemple),
   replace database credentials <login> and <password> by the actual login and
   password (without the ('<' and '>' signs). Eventually, chose an alternate
   name for the DB.

3. Install the photos_gallery
   $ composer install

4. Create the DB and apply the migrations:
   $ php bin/console doctrine:database:create
   $ php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

7. Run the server
   $ php bin/console server:start

KNOWN BUG :
   the file name does not appear in the upload field on the /add page.
