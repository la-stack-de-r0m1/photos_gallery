1. Clone repository
   $ git clone https://github.com/romainbe/photos_gallery.git

2. Enter the photos_gallery and install symfony
   $ cd photos_gallery

3. Rename the file .env.sample into .env:
   $ cp .env.sample .env

4. Open the .env file and, in the line DATABASE_URL (mysql), replace
database credentials <login> and <password> by the actual login and password
(without the ('<' and '>' signs). Eventually, chose an alternate name for
the DB.

5. Run composer
   $ composer install

6. Create the DB and apply migrations
   $ php bin/console doctrine:database:create
   $ php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

7. Run the server
   $ php bin/console server:start

KNOWN BUG :
   the file name does not appear in the upload field on the /add page.
